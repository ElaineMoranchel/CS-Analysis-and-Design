What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-The problem I was solving was expanding pseudocode to address od ABCU. My approach was to look at the requirements and review the draft pseudocode for each data structure and refer back to prior work. Data structures are important to understand the algorithm design and memory efficiency. To overcome any roadblocks I came across, I would look back at some of my drafts and try to look back at my code to fix anything I made a mistake on.  Engaging in these projects has expanded my approach by understanding more about programming approaches and not only understanding the requirements and the code.
